# Yale Phillosophy 176 - Death

## Lecture 1 - Overview
Broadly speaking, the class will cover:
- Metaphysics
	- What kind of entity are we?
	- What does it mean for such entity to _die_?
	- What would it mean for such an entity to survive death?
- Value theory
	- Is death bad? good?
    - Shall we despair about death?

## Lecture 2 - The nature of persons: Dualism vs Physicalism (monism?)
### Assignment
Rosenberg, Jay. “Life After Death: In Search of the Question.” In Thinking Clearly About Death. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1983. pp. 18-22
- does a person survive their death? / could a person survive their death? / is there [more] life after death?
    - _survival_ and _death_ are, commonsensically, predicates that cannot be true of the same thing. (**is this true for all the common senses in the world?**)
    - such a question is almost never posed in its commonsensical absurd meaning. what is it _really_ asking then?
- Death as _the_ end of life
    - more like _an_ end to life
- life vs a life
    - life -> the condition that a living organism experiences
    - a life -> the 'history' or 'experience' of a living organism
    - a life can end without life ending (like amoabe dividing)
- does a person's history come to an end with their death? / is a persons death an event in their history? / is a person's death a passage between two conditions?
    - one 'easy answer': yes (lots of things happen to dead persons: buried, cremated, honored, remembered...)
    - 'opposite categories'
        - tall - short kind (situated on a kind)
        - wet - dry (admitting of degree)
        - awake - asleep (not admitting of degree)
        - genuine - counterfit (not admitting the possibility of a tranistion from one category to another)
    - easy answer admits that the person kind transitions from alive category to dead category (but is a dead person a person/is a counterfit passport a passport?)
- is a dead person a person
    - dead person <-> counterfit passport <-> a nominal object ( smile ) is an object
    - unlike saying someone _is alive_, saying someone _is dead_ (they have died) is more like reporting on something that happened to a person (who is no more(?))
    - our handling of 'dead' persons merely requires that they existed, not that they exist (what is it to exist?)
    - language obscures that dead people _are_ not in the same way that living people _are_
- time
    - process (a length of time) vs event (point in time)
